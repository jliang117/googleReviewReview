"""
A crawler to get reviews from specified apps.

I have created a list of top apps in file 'appsid'. This list is created
on a particular day of july month and it contains 3000 apps ids with their
category rank less than 10 on that specific day.

After running the crawler: Two files are created positive.txt and negative.txt
