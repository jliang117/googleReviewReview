# Purpose
Performing my own exploration on data analysis and NLP using google app review text data

It's really simple to build a model that tries to classify reviews into wholly positive or negative (5 or 1) but humans are 
slightly more nuanced, and can point out specific deficiencies or positives in a product or experience. 

# Idealized features
categorical breakdown of what the review is specifically saying

identify groups and trends of issues stemming from the set of reviews
